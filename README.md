# Calculator
basic calculator
 basic calculator as an exercise.
Allows basic calculations, calculations on negative numbers, decimal fractions etc. 
I dealt with the issue of multiple '.' common in other calculators.
I have an issue with history tab: '-' and '/' calculations are exactly as math in js suggests, but they should be shown in inverted order.
